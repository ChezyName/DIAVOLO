# Main Menu and Lobby
This game uses a simple lobby system where the player sets thier username at the start of the game and is able to host or join from that menu.
> This game also uses *Listen Servers* Where The Hosting Player Is The Server and A Client. If Hosting, Host On Port 7777 // Port Forward On Port 7777

Once the player either joins or hosts a game `Can Join Locally [LAN] By Using 127.0.0.1 as IP Address`, The Server waits for all players to select a character, this is also indicated by the icon to the right of the players name *Left Side Of The Lobby Screen.* Once all players choose a character, the game would then wait for players to vote on a boss to fight together. Then load up the game.
  

# Movement System (Top Down)

The Movement in this game is a bit sketch. Basically The *Player Controller* Controls A Pawn That Was Spawned For The Player That Controls Another Pawn (**Server Pawn**) That Holds All The Abilities And Animations. The **SERVER** Pawn Is Controlled By An AI Controller In Order To Use The "Move To" Function. This Allows The Player To Move Their Character (TOP-DOWN) While Replicating To The Server

# Controls
In game controls take a mix from **Diablo** and **League of Legends**
**Movement:** To move the Character, You hold or press **LMB** `Left Mouse Button` Where You Want To Move.
Additionally The Player Has A ***Dodge Roll*** Ability Where The Player Gains *I-Frames* `Invisibility Frames` During 80% of the Roll.

The Player has a few states that they can be in currently:

**E_IDLE, E_MOVE, E_MOVE_ATTACK, E_ATTACK_WINDUP,

## **The Beast** Spiderman 2099 ReImagined

**The Beast** is a mock recreation of Spiderman 2099 from the hit movie *Spiderman: Across The Spiderverse*. In this game, **The Beast** is a high damage, low health, burst assassin who plays an in-and-out playstyle meaning the player should go in, deal high damage, and get out.

# Crimson Queen: The First Boss
Crimson Queen is a the broke-mans version of Lilith from [Diablo IV](https://diablo4.blizzard.com/en-us/). A Demon from the burring pits of Hell, Crimson Queen sends her foes back to Hell where she can endlessly control them from thier mind, to thier body.
As a character, Crimson Queen uses a ton of projectiles and beam attacks. When fighting her, Id recommend using [**The Beast**](#the-beast-spiderman-2099-reimagined) as his Ultimate ***Razor Blossom*** can take care of ***Crimson Queens Hounds***, speaking of ***Crimson Hounds*** Here are all of **Crimson Queen's** Abilities:
| **Crimson Hounds** |  **Hells Pit** |  **Deadly Scythes** |  **Crimson Blast** |  **FINAL STRIKE** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Crimson Queen** Summons *6 to 12* **Crimson Hounds** to bite the Player | **Crimson Queen** Summons A *Magic Circle* That Unleashes <1% of Hells Energy *(Vertical Attack)* | **Crimson Queen** Spins Her Scythes In Her Hand | **Crimson Queen** Summons A *Magic Circle* Unleashing A Hellish Beam Spinning And Dealing Damage | **Crimson Queen** Summons A *Large Beam* From The Center Of The Map Turning Clockwise Dealing ***MASSIVE DAMAGE*** `UnDodgeable` |

Now that you understand Crimson Queens Attacks, you can try and beat her. Good Luck Gamers!
